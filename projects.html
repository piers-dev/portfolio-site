      <h3>Bratus Saltus</h3>
      <p>
        Bratus Saltus is a fast-paced speedrunning platformer about using
        special 'seeds' with interesting properties. The game sees you using
        your vine whip to create platforms at will and teleport around levels,
        all for a better time.
        <br /><br />
        The game was developed for the Global Game Jam 2023. I was the gameplay
        programmer, graphics programmer, and level designer for our team of
        three.

      <h3>Death to Die</h3>
      <p>
        Death to Die is cozy-yet-violent RPG about fighting off hoards of
        polyhedral enemies using your elemental powers. The game was developed
        for the GMTK Game Jam 2022.
        <br /><br />
        I was responsible for everything in-engine, including code, particles,
        and most shaders. I also modelled the main character and made a lot of
        the animations that can be seen in-game.

      <h3>Cat Walk Simulator</h3>
      <p>
        Cat Walk Simulator is a hilarious, lighthearted bullet-hell game about
        defending your meandering cat from an onslaught of angry neighbours. The
        game was developed for the GMTK Game Jam 2021.
        <br /><br />
        I created all of the code, effects, levels, and UI for the game. I also
        designed most of the characters, and oversaw the integration of assets
        from the other artist I was working with.

      <h3>Oh god TOO FAST</h3>
      <p>
        Oh god TOO FAST is an intense high-score game about piloting a space ship through fields of debris. The twist is that your ship needs fuel only to brake and turn, so steering it away from hazards can be quite the challenge. 
        The game was developed for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.
        <br /><br />
        I made all of the code, effects, and UI for the game. This includes the infinite level generation and gravity physics. I was also responsible for implementing art and music from my teammates.
